Python3 control flow graph generator

StatiCFG is a package that can be used to produce control flow graphs (CFGs) for Python 3 programs. T
he CFGs it generates can be easily visualised with graphviz and used for static analysis.
This analysis is actually the main purpose of the module, hence the name of StatiCFG.
